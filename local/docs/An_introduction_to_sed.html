<h2 align="center">An introduction to sed</h2>

<p>
<b>
This qref is written for a semi-knowledgable UNIX user who has just
come up against a problem and has been advised to use <i>sed</i> to solve it.
Perhaps one of the examples can be quickly modified for immediate use.

<h2><a name="info">For More Info</a></h2>
A good reference for sed is the O'Reilly handbook for <i>sed and
awk</i>.  There should be a copy available in the CS Department
library. Further references are the <i>UNIX in a Nutshell</i> and <i>UNIX
Power Tools</i> books, also in the CS Department library.
<p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<i>sed</i> reads from a file or from its standard input, and outputs to its
standard output.  You will generally want to redirect that into a
file, but that is not done in these examples just because it takes up
space.  sed does not get along with non-text files, like executables
and FrameMaker files.  If you need to edit those, use a binary editor
like hexl-mode in emacs.

<li>
The most frustrating thing about trying to learn sed is getting your
program past the shell's parser. The proper way is to use single
quotes around the program, like so:
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed 's/fubar/foobar/' filename</samp>
<p> 
The single quotes protect almost everything from the shell.  In csh or
tcsh, you still have to watch out for exclamation marks, but other
than that, you're safe.

<li>
The second most frustrating thing about trying to learn <i>sed</i> is the
lovely error messages:
<pre>
	sed 's/fubar/foobar' filename
	sed: command garbled: s/fubar/foobar
</pre>

<li>
The GNU version of <i>sed</i> generally has better error messages:
<pre>
	gsed 's/fubar/foobar' filename
	gsed: Unterminated `s' command
</pre>
So, if you're having problems getting <i>sed</i> syntax correct, switch to
<i>gsed</i> for a while.
</ul>

<h2><a name="basics">Some basics:</a></h2>
In all probability, the command you need most is the "s" command.  It
Substitutes one thing for another.  The simplest way to do this is
like the above examples:
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed 's/color/colour/g' filename</samp>
<p>
The "g" at the end stands for "global".  What it really means, though,
is to replace every occurence on the line.  If you leave it off, only
the first occurence on each line will be changed.
<p>

You will encounter problems if you attempt to use the following
characters in the string to replace:
<pre>
	.*[]^$\
</pre>
These characters mean special things.  If you mean to replace literal
occurences of those characters, preface them with a backslash.  So,
don't do
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed 's/[J.S. Bach {$ for music}]/[Bach, J.S {$ for music}]/' filename</samp>
<p>
Instead, do
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed 's/\[J\.S\. Bach {\$ for music}\]/[Bach, J.S {$ for music}]/' filename</samp>
<p>
Note that this does not apply to the replacement string.
<p>
What if you want to perform more than one such replacement at a time?
You would try something like this:
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed 's/color/colour/g' 's/flavor/flavour/g' filename</samp>
<p>
but it wouldn't work.  sed would look for a file named "g" in the
directory "s/flavor/flavour".  The "-e" flag to sed makes it realize
that the next option is a part of the script, instead of a filename.
You also must use it for the first part of the script, when you have
more than one part. So, you would use
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed -e 's/color/colour/g' -e 's/flavor/flavour/g' filename</samp>
<p>
If you only had one replacement to do, you could still use the "-e"
flag, but you don't need to.
<p>
The various commands are applied in the order given to sed, so if you
ran
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed -e 's/color/colour/g' -e 's/colour/color/g' filename</samp>
<p>
it would turn "color" to "colour" and then back to "color".  So, all
occurences of "color" or "colour" would end up as "color".  This is an
inefficient way to do that, though.
<p>
What if you want to replace something that contains a '/' character?
This is a common problem with filenames.  You could escape each one,
like so:
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed 's/\/usr\/bin/\/bin/g' filename</samp>
<p>
This is not fun for long pathnames.  There is a nice alternative: <i>sed</i>
will treat the character immediately after the 's' as the separator,
so you could do something like
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed 's#/usr/bin#/bin#g' filename</samp>
<p>
<a href="#menu">back to the top</a>
<hr>
<h3><a name="regexp">Using regular expressions</a></h3>
<i>sed</i> can use regular expressions just like <i>ed</i>(1) can.  Here are some
common uses of regular expressions.

<ul>
<li>
The '^' character means the beginning of the line.
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed 's/^Thu /Thursday/' filename</samp>
<p>
will turn "Thu " into "Thursday", but only at the beginning of
the line.  Note that the "g" flag is not used, since you can't have
multiple beginnings of a line. Also note that you don't need to put
the '^' in the replacement string.
<li>
The '$' character means the end of the line.
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed 's/ $//' filename</samp>
<p>
will replace any space character that occurs at the end of a line.
Again, the "g" flag is not used, and the '$' is not used in the
replacement string.
<p>
You can "replace" the end of the line, like this:
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed 's/$/EOL/' filename</samp>
<p>
This does not form one long line, but it puts the string "EOL" at the
end of each line.
<p>
You can match a blank line by specifying an end-of-line immediately
after a beginning-of-line:
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed 's/^$/this used to be a blank line/' filename</samp>

<li>
The '.' character means "any character".  This does not mean the
beginning or end of a line, though.  If you were using a log file
which had the date in the form "Wed Dec 31 16:00:00 1969" and wanted
to erase the dates and times from a certain month and year, you could
use
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed 's/Apr .. ..:..:.. 1980/Apr 1980/g' filename</samp>

<li>
The square brackets "[]" are used to specify any one of a number of
characters.  This is useful when you don't know if a letter will be
upper or lower case:
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed 's/[Oo]pen[Ww]in/openwin/g' filename </samp>
<p>
<li>
You can specify a range of characters using a '-' inside the square
brackets.  This will include any character between (in ASCII terms)
the two listed. If you wanted to delete middle initials, you could use
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed 's/ [A-Z]\. / /g' filename</samp>
<p>
Notice that the literal period had to be escaped, as mentioned above.
Also, we had to go from two spaces (one on each side of the middle
initial) to one.

<li>
If you want to exclude a set or range of characters, use the '^'
character as the first thing inside the brackets:
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed 's/ [^A-DHM-Z]\. / /g' filename</samp>
<p>
This will delete any middle initials that are not A,B,C,D,H,M,N,...,Z.

<li>
The '*' character means "any number of the previous character".  This
applies both to literal characters and to characters that are a result
of using "[]" or '.'.  For example,
<p>
<b>&gt</b><samp>sed 's/ *$//' filename</samp>
<p>
deletes all trailing spaces from each line, while
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed 's/[ ]*$//' filename</samp>
<p>
deletes any sequence of trailing tabs and spaces.  It also works when
using "[^]":
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed 's/[ ][^ ]*$//' filename</samp>
<p>
deletes the last word (sequence of non-spaces) on each line.
<p>
It is important to know that '*' will match zero occurences.  If you
need to match an integer, for example,
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed 's/ [0-9]* / integer /g' filename</samp>
<p>
will turn "  " into " integer ", which is not what you want.  In this
case, you should use
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed 's/ [0-9][0-9]* / integer /g' filename</samp>
<p>
which will demand at least one digit.

<li>
The combination ".*" means any number of any character.  So,
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed 's/col.*lapse/collapse/g' filename</samp>
<p>
will act on any line which contains the letters "col" and then
"lapse", no matter what is in between.  The '*' character is greedy:
it takes as many characters as it can.  So, the above script would
turn
<pre>
	a b col d e f lapse h i j k lapse m n
</pre>
into
<pre>
	a b collapse m n
</pre>
instead of
<pre>
	a b collapse h i j k lapse m n
</pre>
</ul>

<h3><a name="subsav">Substitution and Saving</a></h3>
Up to this point, we have concentrated on deleting things that we
match with "[]" and '.'.  That's because we had no way of saving what
we matched.  The "\(" and "\)" operators will save whatever is found
between them.  Notice that these parentheses must be preceded by a
backslash, while the characters ^$[].*\ don't need a backslash to act
in a non-literal fashion.  The first pair of "\(\)" saves into a place
called "\1", and the second pair into "\2", and so on.
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed 's/^\([A-Z][A-Za-z]*\), \([A-Z][A-Za-z]*\)/\2 \1/' filename</samp>
<p>
will turn "Lastname, Firstname" into "Firstname Lastname".  Notice how
the comma is placed outside the first pair of "\(\)" so it doesn't get
inclued in the last name.  Otherwise, the result would be "Firstname
Lastname,".
<p>
Sometimes you will want to apply a substitution only to lines that
meet some criteria that you can't specify in the string to be
replaced.  You do this using something called an "address".  It comes
before the "s" command.  You can limit the command to a range of
lines:
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed '1,20s/foobar/fubar/g' filename</samp>
<p>
The line count is cumulative across files, and starts at 1.
<p>
You might want to apply a change only to lines that contain a string:
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed '/^Aug/s/Mon /Monday /g' filename</samp>
<p>
Or to lines that don't contain a string:

<ul>
<li>
	using sh or ksh or bash,
<p>
<b>&gt></b><samp>sed '/^Aug/!s/Mon /Monday /g' filename</samp>
<p>
	using csh or tcsh,
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed '/^Aug/\!s/Mon /Monday /g' filename</samp>
<p>
</ul>
You can also apply the command to all lines between (and including) a
start string and a stop string:
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed '/^Aug/,/^Oct/s/Mon /Monday /g' filename</samp>
<p>
Normally sed reads a line, processes it, and prints it out.  If you
only want to see the lines that your command acted upon, then you
don't want it to print out everyting.  The "-n" flag will stop sed
from printing after processing.  So,
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed -n 's/fubar/foobar/g' filename</samp>
<p>
will print nothing at all.  You must use the 'p' flag to the 's'
command to make it print out what it has processed:
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed -n 's/fubar/foobar/gp' filename</samp>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="sedscr">Sed from a file</a></h3>
If your sed script is getting long, you can put it into a file, like so:
<pre>
	# This file is named "sample.sed"
	# comments can only appear in a block at the beginning
	s/color/colour/g
	s/flavor/flavour/g
	s/theater/theatre/g
</pre>
Then call sed with the "-f" flag:
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>sed -f sample.sed filename</samp>
<p>
Or, you can make an executable sed script:
<pre>
	#!/usr/bin/sed -f
	# This file is named "sample2.sed"
	s/color/colour/g
	s/flavor/flavour/g
	s/theater/theatre/g
</pre>
then give it execute permissions:
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>chmod u+x sample2.sed</samp>
<p>
and then call it like so:
<p>
<b>&gt;</b><samp>./sample2.sed filename</samp>
